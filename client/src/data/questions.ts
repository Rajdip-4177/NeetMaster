For 40 g of Ca (40), number of moles = 40 g / 40 g/mol = 1 mol, number of atoms = 1 mol × 6.022 × 10²³ atoms/mol = 6.022 × 10²³ atoms. For 48 g of Mg (24), number of moles = 48 g / 24 g/mol = 2 mol, number of atoms = 2 mol × 6.022 × 10²³ atoms/mol = 12.044 × 10²³ atoms. For 19 g of F₂ (19×2), number of moles = 19 g / 38 g/mol = 0.5 mol, number of atoms = 0.5 mol × 2 atoms/molecule × 6.022 × 10²³ molecules/mol = 6.022 × 10²³ atoms. For 20 g of Ne (20), number of moles = 20 g / 20 g/mol = 1 mol, number of atoms = 1 mol × 6.022 × 10²³ atoms/mol = 6.022 × 10²³ atoms. Therefore, 12 g of C and 40 g of Ca have the same number of atoms, and 19 g of F₂ and 20 g of Ne have the same number of atoms."

From the balanced equation, 1 mol of C produces 1 mol of CO₂. Therefore, moles of CO₂ produced = 0.0833 mol. Mass of CO₂ = 0.0833 mol × 44 g/mol = 3.67g. However, the problem states that 2g of gas was collected, which is less than the theoretical yield. This could be due to incomplete combustion or collection. Regardless, the gas collected would be CO₂ since it's the product of complete combustion of carbon in air."

For the first option: Moles of A needed for 3 mol of B = 3 × (2/3) = 2 mol. Moles of A needed for 2 mol of C = 2 × (2/4) = 1 mol. Since 2 mol of A are available, A is not the limiting reactant. Moles of B needed for 2 mol of A = 2 × (3/2) = 3 mol. Moles of B needed for 2 mol of C = 2 × (3/4) = 1.5 mol. Since 3 mol of B are available, B is not the limiting reactant.

    correctOptionIndex: 1,

    explanation: "Step 1: Find the empirical formula. For 100 g of compound: Mass of C = 96 g, Mass of H = 4 g. Moles of C = 96 / 12 = 8 mol. Moles of H = 4 / 1 = 4 mol. The ratio C:H = 8:4 = 2:1. Therefore, the empirical formula is C₂H. Step 2: Find the molecular formula. At STP, 1 mol of any gas occupies 22.4 L. Volume of 0.2 g of compound = 70 mL = 0.07 L. Number of moles = 0.07 / 22.4 = 0.003125 mol. Molar mass = 0.2 g / 0.003125 mol = 64 g/mol. Empirical formula mass of C₂H = 2(12) + 1 = 25 g/mol. n = Molecular mass / Empirical formula mass = 64 / 25 = 2.56, which is approximately 2.5 (or 5/2). Therefore, the molecular formula is approximately (C₂H)₂.₅, which is C₅H₂.₅. However, this is not a valid molecular formula. The closest valid formula from the given options is C₂H₂, which has a molar mass of 26 g/mol."

For 0.3 mol of SiF₄: Number of atoms = 0.3 mol × (1 + 4) atoms/molecule × 6.022 × 10²³ molecules/mol = 0.3 × 5 × 6.022 × 10²³ = 9.03 × 10²² atoms.

According to the balanced equation, 1 mol of N₂ requires 3 mol of H₂. Therefore, 714.3 mol of N₂ requires 3 × 714.3 = 2142.9 mol of H₂.

    questionText: "Calculate the average atomic mass of chlorine if 75% of chlorine atoms have a mass of 35 amu and 25% have a mass of 37 amu.",
    options: [
      "35.5 amu",
      "36.0 amu",
      "36.5 amu",
      "37.5 amu"
    ],
    correctOptionIndex: 0,
    selectedOptionIndex: null,
    explanation: "Average atomic mass = (Fraction of isotope 1 × Mass of isotope 1) + (Fraction of isotope 2 × Mass of isotope 2) = (0.75 × 35 amu) + (0.25 × 37 amu) = 26.25 amu + 9.25 amu = 35.5 amu."
